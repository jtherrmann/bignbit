The source of [mgrs_gibs_intersection.json.pickle](mgrs_gibs_intersection.json.pickle) is from the Impact HLS project
found here: [mgrs_gibs_intersection.json](https://github.com/NASA-IMPACT/hls-browse_imagery/blob/c13b9abe7d9625ee4e375a8406ff32ada0a89658/hls_browse_imagery_creator/data/mgrs_gibs_intersection.json)

The copy found here is simply the original json put through pickle to compress it a bit.

It is unknown at this time how the original json data was created but we need to use it 
so that we can process OPERA data in the same manner the HLS data was processed.
